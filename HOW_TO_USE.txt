HOW TO USE — Title Generator


This document explains how to use the Title Generator step by step.
No programming knowledge is required.


--------------------------------------------------
1. INPUT CSV
--------------------------------------------------

The generator uses a CSV file as input data.

Location:
- The CSV file must be placed inside the Data folder.
- Do NOT rename or move the Data folder.

Required columns:
- name
- role(optional)
The role column may be left empty (e.g. for actors).
Titles will still be generated correctly.
- start
- end

Time format:
- HH:MM:SS
- Example: 00:00:05

You can edit the CSV file using any text editor or spreadsheet software.
Make sure the file structure and column names remain unchanged.


--------------------------------------------------
2. CONFIGURATION FILE (ConfigJohnson)
--------------------------------------------------

The configuration file controls global settings for the composition.

What you can configure:
- Composition duration
- Resolution and frame rate
- Text appearance
- Background behavior

Background option:
- transparent: false
  Creates titles with a visible background.

- transparent: true
  Creates titles with a fully transparent background.
  Useful for overlaying titles on top of video.

The config file can be opened with a text editor.
On macOS it may also open automatically in After Effects — this is normal.


--------------------------------------------------
3. WORKFLOW (STEP BY STEP)
--------------------------------------------------

1. Edit the input CSV file.
2. Adjust settings in the configuration file if needed.
3. Install After Effects Script

To make the script available directly inside After Effects, you must copy it into the After Effects Scripts folder.

1. Locate the script file:
   ae/TitleGenerator.jsx

2. Copy it to the After Effects Scripts directory:

   macOS:
   Applications/Adobe After Effects <version>/Scripts/

   Windows:
   C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects <version>\Scripts\

3. Restart After Effects.

After that, the script will appear in:
File → Scripts → TitleGenerator

This allows you to run the script directly from After Effects without using file search.

4. Run the generator script.
5. Titles are generated automatically based on the data.


--------------------------------------------------
4. IMPORTANT NOTES
--------------------------------------------------

- Do NOT move or rename project folders.
- After Effects uses fixed paths to locate input data.
- The generator reads files only from its own project structure.
- Make sure Python is installed before running the Python part.
